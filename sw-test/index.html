    <details>
      <summary>Expand/Collapse</summary>
      <p>The following page is Jinwook Shin's very first project built with HTML5 Components to show his web development
      capability. This HTML project will be followed by CSS and JavaScript projects to comprise a one big web development
      portfolio.</p><br>
    </details>


    <h2>Q. Why did you make this page?</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Expand/Collapse</summary>
      <p>We use World Wide Web on daily basis. I also use it everyday. I made this webpage because I was interested in 
      web technology and I wanted to show my capability to build a page using HTML.<br><br>

      <h3>1. Status Bar</h3> 
      <p>Status Bar at the top of the page indicates whether there is an online connection or not.
      When it's online, it is indicated with a green bar and when it's not, it is indicated with a red bar. </p>
      <h3>2. Webcam & Canvas</h3>
      <p>You will see two square boxes located in the middle of the page. The one on the left is a web camera. 
      To your right is a canvas that works as an image holder, also as a drawing canvas. </p>
      <h3>3. Service Worker</h3>
      <p>The easy way to describe it is that it allows you to have an offline experience. In a more expert way,
      it is one of the web workers that acts as a proxy server. Here is the reason why I am using it. </p>
      <h3>4. Local Storage</h3>
