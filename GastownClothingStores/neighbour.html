    <p>
      Introduction : Neighbour is a men's shop founded in Vancouver, BC.
      We carry clothes, items and objects that we admire.
      Some we have followed for years and others have stepped into our life more recently.
      They are objects, they are garments and they are books that tell stories.
      We are that honest neighbour that always listens, reflects and helps out when you need it.
      We hope you admire the things we have found as much as we do.<br><br>
      Genre : Minimal, European<br><br>
