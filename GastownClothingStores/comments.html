    <p>
      The reason why I made this website is because Gastown is pretty much the only place I love in Vancouver.
      When I was living in Vancouver in my high school days, I was not so of an outgoing student.
      After taking some time off in my home country, I had to come back to Vancouver and I had hard time getting
      used to the environment again because I could not find any places that I can enjoy. My main interest was in fashion and music
      and I couldn't find a place to enjoy my hobbies.<br><br>

      Fortunately, I found Gastown where it has all the well-known clothing shops. The interior design and the clothes of the shops
      were very inspiring to me. The people there were also lively, from the locals to tourists. Therefore, I wanted to share my experience
      with others who are not used to Gastown or with tourists who want to see some good clothing stores in Vancouver.<br><br>
