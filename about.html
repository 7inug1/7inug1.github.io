    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing Diploma of Computer Studies at Langara College. Previously, I was studying
      Public Administration at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, South Korea. I decided to switch my major
      as I have always been interested in Information Technology.<br><br>

      It was my very first time learning programming when I came to Vancouver. There were times that programming got
      me very frustrated, those were great opportunities to let me change my obsolete mindset to become a more mature person.<br><br>

      Other than my academic career, I like to read books, do exercising, and watch self-development and motivational videos to
      learn life lessons. As a student pursuing a new career path, I also wish to be a better programmer, so I try to allocate
      my free time in studying coding as well.<br><br>

      Thanks for taking your time to browse my website. I hope you have a great day.
